# Hunger Crunch  

## WILL YOU HELP US TAKE HUNGER DOWN?  
For too long, world hunger has destroyed the lives and ruined the dreams of children around the world. Hunger Crunch gives you the opportunity to fight back and have some fun at the same time. [Hunger Crunch](http://www.hungercrunch.com) is a game for and by [Rice Bowls](http://ricebowls.org), a nonprofit working to feed orphaned children where the need is greatest. When you play, you can help provide much-needed food to these awesome kids.  

## Game Assets  
We spent a long time making Hunger Crunch...a lot longer than we ever though it should take. This repository includes assets from our game. We hope that you can use them in creative ways to teach people of all ages how to code. And when you or your students make a game, hopefully these assets will make your experience a little easier. Enjoy!
